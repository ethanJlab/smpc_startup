# SMPC Startup

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to create an SMPC (Secure Multi-Party Communication) network to facilitate the transfer of digital assets 
across multiple blockchains in a secure and decentralized way.

### Smart Contracts 
Each blockchain will have a proxy smart contract that will be used as a gateway into the SMPC network

### What will the SMPC network consist of?
The SMPC network will consist of multiple nodes run by users from their browsers. Nodes will work together to sign cross-chain transactions
and will be rewarded via crypto (either Ether or our own token).
